# Simulating and Filtering a Sine Wave Signal in Python

## Project Overview

The **Simulating and Filtering a Sine Wave Signal** project aims to demonstrate the generation of composite sine wave signals, the introduction of noise, and the application of a low-pass Butterworth filter to recover the original signal. This project is essential for understanding signal processing techniques, particularly in audio and communications engineering, where the quality of signals is often compromised by noise.

## Introduction to Signal Processing

Signal processing involves analyzing, modifying, and synthesizing signals. In many real-world applications, signals are often contaminated with noise, which can obscure the desired information. The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Generate a composite signal made up of multiple sine waves.
2. Introduce noise to simulate a real-world scenario.
3. Apply a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise while preserving the low-frequency signal.

### Key Concepts

- **Sine Wave**: A mathematical curve that describes a smooth repetitive oscillation. It is characterized by its frequency, amplitude, and phase.
- **Noise**: Unwanted disturbances superimposed on a useful signal, often random and difficult to predict.
- **Low-Pass Filter**: A filter that allows signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating frequencies higher than the cutoff.

## Code Explanation

The project is implemented in Python using the **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy** libraries, which provide powerful tools for numerical calculations and plotting.

### Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Imports

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import signal
```

- **NumPy** is used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib** is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **SciPy** provides modules for optimization, integration, and signal processing, including the functionality to create and apply filters.

### Main Functions

1. **generate_signal(frequencies, amplitudes, fs, duration=1)**: This function generates a composite sine wave signal based on specified frequencies and amplitudes.

   - **Parameters**:
     - `frequencies`: A list of frequencies for the sine waves.
     - `amplitudes`: A list of amplitudes for the sine waves.
     - `fs`: Sampling frequency in Hz.
     - `duration`: Duration of the signal in seconds (default is 1 second).

   - **Returns**: A tuple containing the time vector and the generated composite signal.

   - **Logic**:
     - The time vector `t` is created using `np.linspace()` to cover the specified duration.
     - A composite signal is generated by summing individual sine waves with given frequencies and amplitudes.

```python
def generate_signal(frequencies, amplitudes, fs, duration=1):
    ...
```

2. **apply_lowpass_filter(signal_data, cutoff, fs, order=4)**: This function applies a low-pass Butterworth filter to the provided signal data.

   - **Parameters**:
     - `signal_data`: The input signal to be filtered.
     - `cutoff`: The cutoff frequency for the filter.
     - `fs`: Sampling frequency in Hz.
     - `order`: The order of the filter (default is 4).

   - **Returns**: The filtered signal.

   - **Logic**:
     - The filter coefficients are calculated using `signal.butter()`, which designs a Butterworth filter.
     - The filtered signal is obtained using `signal.sosfilt()`, which applies the filter to the signal data.

```python
def apply_lowpass_filter(signal_data, cutoff, fs, order=4):
    ...
```

3. **plot_signals(t, original_signal, filtered_signal)**: This function creates plots for the original and filtered signals, as well as the frequency response of the filter.

   - **Parameters**:
     - `t`: The time vector.
     - `original_signal`: The noisy original signal.
     - `filtered_signal`: The filtered signal.

   - **Logic**:
     - Three subplots are created: one for the original signal, one for the filtered signal, and one for the frequency response of the filter.
     - The frequency response is computed using `signal.sosfreqz()`.

```python
def plot_signals(t, original_signal, filtered_signal):
    ...
```

### Main Execution

The scriptâ€™s execution begins in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, where parameters for the signal generation and filtering are defined.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `fs`: Sampling frequency (Hz).
  - `frequencies`: List of frequencies representing the desired signal and noise.
  - `amplitudes`: Corresponding amplitudes for each frequency.
  - `duration`: Duration of the signal.
  - `cutoff_frequency`: The cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter.

- The functions are called to generate the signal, apply the low-pass filter, and plot the results.

```python
# Main script parameters and function calls
```

## Visualization

When executed, the project generates plots that illustrate:

1. The **original signal with noise**: This shows the composite signal composed of sine waves along with the noise.
2. The **filtered signal**: This plot highlights the effect of the low-pass filter, demonstrating how it smooths the noisy signal.
3. The **frequency response** of the filter: This illustrates how the filter attenuates frequencies above the cutoff, providing insights into the filter's characteristics.
